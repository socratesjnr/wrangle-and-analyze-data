# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data-With-Python
In this project, I gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety formats, assesed its quality and tidiness, then cleaned it. This is called data wrangling.

The dataset that I wrangled ( analyzed and visualized) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. 

# Key Insights
1. From the analysis done we can see that amongst the dog stages, Pupper has the highest percentage 
2. From the analysis done we can see that amongst the dog stages, Floofer has the lowest percentage
3. From the analysis done we can see that, there is a positive correlation between favourite count and retweet count
